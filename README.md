ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm David, a Front-End Developer with strong skills in Angular (v13+), TypeScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript.

Iâ€™m passionate about creating clean, scalable, and efficient web applications that provide real value and a smooth user experience. I enjoy collaborating with teams and continuously learning new technologies â€” currently expanding my skills with React and Docker.

Among my projects is SkateScanner, a web platform that compares prices of skateboards from over 150 European shops, helping users save money and find the best deals. Itâ€™s built with Angular 19 and Node.js/Express, and Iâ€™m excited to keep evolving it by adding community features and supporting non-profit initiatives.

Feel free to check out my repositories to see my work and contributions. Iâ€™m always open to connecting and collaborating on interesting projects, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!

Thanks for stopping by ;)

David
